            <h2>My Life at PKU</h2>
            <p>I enjoy playing table tennis and was a member of my school’s table tennis team. Although I stopped at the second round of the Freshman Cup at PKU, I truly enjoyed the training and competition.</p>
            <img src="../src/table_tennis.jpg" alt="Playing Table Tennis" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:400px; height:auto;">

            <p>I am also passionate about debating and joined the school debating team. Through debating, I met many like-minded friends and expanded my perspectives. I am grateful for the guidance of seniors during my freshman year.</p>
            <img src="../src/debate.png" alt="Debating Team" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:400px; height:auto;">

            <p>Grateful for the support I received, I have volunteered in various university events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>University sports meeting – helping organize events and transport messages.</li>
                <img src="../src/volunteer.jpg" alt="Sports Meeting" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:400px; height:auto;">
                <li>Freshman welcome events – interacting with students from Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and the USA. For example, I participated in the <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/x08OF4qarHq7c1aNQftxnQ" target="_blank">2024 SCCEI Summer Camp</a>, arranging venues and introducing school culture.</li>
                <img src="../src/SCCEI.jpg" alt="SCCEI Summer" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:400px; height:auto;">
            </ul>

            <p>I also participated in the “Fertile Soil Project,” a social practice program organized by our school. During this project, we visited a major state-owned enterprise to learn about its business operations. Over the course of a week of field visits and interviews, we gained valuable insights into the company’s management and development, and ultimately produced a comprehensive report on its growth.</p>

            <p>Besides sports and volunteering, I enjoy developing practical projects using machine learning and web technologies. For instance, I created an app with my schoolmates that recommends Chinese cuisine based on available ingredients: <a href="https://cuisine527.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Cuisine Today!</a></p>
            <!-- <div class="image-row"> -->

                <img src="../src/cuisine2.png" alt="demo 2">
            <!-- </div> -->
            <p>This idea came from my exchange experience at UCB. Sometimes when facing random ingredients in the fridge, I didn’t know what to cook. This app helps you choose a Chinese dish and provides cooking steps.</p>

            <h2>My Life at UCB</h2>
            <p>Studying at UC Berkeley was an exciting experience. During my time there, I had the honor of meeting Nobel Prize winner David Card.</p>
            <img src="../src/david_card.jpg" alt="Meeting David Card" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:400px; height:auto;">
            
            <p>I made new friends with my kind neighbors, who invited my roommates and me to celebrate the Lunar New Year together. I even received a red packet from my landlord! I feel so lucky to have met such wonderful people.</p>

            <p>Our project director invited us to watch an NBA game in Los Angeles — the Warriors versus the Bulls.</p>

            <p>I got my driver’s license and enjoyed a memorable road trip along Highway 1 by the sea with my schoolmates.</p>
